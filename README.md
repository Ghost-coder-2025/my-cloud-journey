# ☁️ My Cloud / DevOps Journey

My name is Mohamed Roble. I'm a senior Computer Science student focused on becoming a professional Cloud / DevOps / Infrastructure Engineer.

This journey is not just about learning tools. It’s about learning how real systems run, how to keep them online, how to secure them, and how to make them repeatable.

---

## Why I'm Doing This

Modern companies run on infrastructure: cloud platforms, networks, identity systems, automation pipelines, monitoring, and security controls. If that infrastructure is weak, the business is weak.

I want to be the person who understands that infrastructure end to end — how it’s built, how it scales, how it’s secured, and how it’s maintained.

This journey is me training to think and act like that engineer.

## What I'm Learning

### 1. Cloud Fundamentals

I’m learning how cloud platforms (like AWS) actually work:

* how compute, storage, networking, identity, and security all connect
* how resources are created, configured, and locked down
* how cost and performance affect real decisions

This helps me think in terms of “what should we build and why,” not just “what button do I click.”

### 2. Infrastructure Mindset

I’m learning how to design environments the way real teams do:

* separating public-facing components from private/internal ones
* giving systems just enough access, not unlimited access
* planning for reliability, not just first launch

This mindset is what turns a basic setup into something you’d trust in production.

### 3. Security and Least Privilege

I’m practicing how to limit access, audit changes, and protect sensitive data.
To me, security isn’t an afterthought. It’s built into how I design things.

That’s critical for any infrastructure or DevOps role, because you’re not just standing things up — you’re responsible for keeping them safe.

### 4. Automation

I’m learning to automate routine work instead of doing everything manually.
That includes:

* using scripts and tooling to collect information from systems
* building repeatable processes so setup isn’t “magic,” it’s documented and reliable

Automation matters because real teams don’t want “it works on my laptop.”
They want “it works every time, anywhere, with the same result.”

### 5. Observability and Accountability

I’m training myself to think in terms of visibility:

* How do I know if something is healthy?
* How do I know who changed what?
* How do I trace a problem to the cause?

This is the mindset of reliability engineering. You’re not guessing — you’re measuring.

## How This Grows Me Toward a Professional Role

This journey is building me in four ways that are directly relevant to Cloud / DevOps / Infrastructure roles:

1. **Technical depth**
   I’m learning the core pieces: cloud services, networking, access control, scripting, and automation.
   These are the foundations of infrastructure work.

2. **Operational thinking**
   I’m not just asking “how do I deploy this,” I’m asking:

   * Is it secure?
   * Can it scale?
   * Can I recover it if it breaks?
   * Can someone else understand it after me?

   That’s the difference between “student project” and “production mindset.”

3. **Problem ownership**
   I’m training myself to find problems (waste, misconfiguration, weak access, bad network exposure) and fix them instead of waiting for someone else to notice.

   That’s what good DevOps / infrastructure engineers do: they don’t just build, they improve.

4. **Communication and clarity**
   I’m learning to explain why something is built a certain way — not just what it is.
   In cloud and infrastructure teams, being able to explain tradeoffs (cost, security, reliability) to other people is part of the job.

## What This Means Long-Term

My goal isn’t just “get a job in cloud.”
My goal is to be trusted with real infrastructure.

That means:

* I understand how systems are put together.
* I can talk about security, not ignore it.
* I can automate repeatable work.
* I can document what I build so someone else can run it.
* I can think about cost, safety, blast radius, and uptime.

This journey is how I’m building those habits now — before I’m officially in the role.

## Summary

I am actively developing into a Cloud / DevOps / Infrastructure engineer by focusing on:

* cloud fundamentals,
* secure access and isolation,
* automation and repeatability,
* reliability and visibility,
* and the ability to explain my decisions.

This repo exists to track that development as I go from student to someone who can be trusted with real systems.
